# Power Platform CLI exercise

This repo was generated from 
`pac solution init`
an attempt was made to 
`pac solution sync`
but the solution did not show

A solution with the same name **pacDemo** was created in the PowerApps Maker portal
in the dev environment. 2 tables were created as well as a near empty canvas app.

One goal is to discover if canvas apps can be generated (or scaffolded) locally and pushed to the Solution.

Other goals will be flushed out and added during an ALM learning curve.
